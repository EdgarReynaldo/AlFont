# AlFont
The latest code from the alfont project, mirrored and updated here

This library forks the semi-popular allegro 4 font library addon, enabling the use of TTF fonts in Allegro 4.

All code not including updates from me is copyright of the respective authors. I have chosen the GNU General Public License 2 to respect the spirit of the library and its original licensing terms.

Source code tree starts with AlFont 2.0.9 and a critical patch included that fixes a crash bug.

See http://opensnc.sourceforge.net/alfont/ for details.
